## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed overview of our Inventory Management System - the goals it is designed to achieve.

### 1.2 Scope
This document details the software requirements for the Inventory Management System. It outlines the system's capabilities, interfaces, and intended users. This system will manage inventory tracking, user authentication, and reporting within a local, offline environment.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **IMS**: Inventory Management System
- **UI**: User Interface
- **RFID**: Radio Frequency Identification

### 1.5 Overview
The subsequent sections provide a comprehensive breakdown of the system's functionality, user requirements, and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Inventory Management System is a standalone application designed to run offline on local hardware, providing inventory tracking and management capabilities without the need for internet connectivity.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Track inventory with QR codes.
- Authenticate users through a RFID tags.
- Generate reports on inventory status and history.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Admins**: Manage inventory and user accounts.
- **Users**: Access inventory tracking and checkout features.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
The IMS will operate on a standard PC running Windows 10 or newer, without the need for internet access.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must function entirely offline.
- The system must be user-friendly and require minimal training.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Feature 1: Inventory Tracking
#### Description and Priority
High priority. Enables tracking of inventory items using QR codes and RFID tags.

#### Stimulus/Response Sequences
Users scan item tags to check in or out inventory items.

#### Functional Requirements
- FR1: The system shall allow QR code scanning to identify items.
- FR2: The system shall support RFID tag reading for inventory tracking.

### 3.2 Feature 2: User Authentication
#### Description and Priority
Medium priority. Securely identifies users before allowing access to the system.

#### Stimulus/Response Sequences
Users log in using credentials verified by the system.

#### Functional Requirements
- FR1: The system shall authenticate users before allowing access to inventory management features.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- The system shall provide a graphical user interface for all user interactions.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- The system requires a PC with a USB port for the RFID reader and a camera for QR code scanning.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- The system shall operate on Windows 10 or newer.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces
- N/A, as the system operates offline.

## 5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- The system shall respond to user input within 2 seconds.

### 5.2 Safety Requirements
- The system shall securely store user credentials and inventory data.

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- The system shall encrypt sensitive data stored locally.

### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
- Reliability: The system shall operate consistently under expected conditions.
- Usability: The system shall be easy to use with minimal training.

## 6. Other Requirements
Specify any additional requirements not covered by the previous sections.

## Appendix A: Glossary
Define all the terms and acronyms used throughout the document.

## Appendix B: Analyzing Data
Detail any data analysis methods or requirements relevant to the project.

## Appendix C: To Be Determined List
List any items that are still under consideration or need further research.
